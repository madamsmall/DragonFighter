# DragonFighter
Simple Text based Java game for fighting dragons and learning how to use Objects

This is intended for developers who are new to coding, or maybe just new to Java. The game plays, but man is it BORING.

Try a couple rounds, then get into the code and spice it up a bit. Several TODO's for suggestions but the game is totally open to being changed.

Kill some dragons!
